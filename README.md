# conscripter

Static site that generates functional open type font files for conlang scripts from SVG using substitution.

Conlangs (or 'constructed languages') frequently feature in all kinds of media. Sindarin, one of the languages of elves constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien is a particularily well known example. Equally as recognizable is Tengwar - the script that features heavily in the movies.

Creating a script for a conlang is a complex process, but one part which should not be that complex is actually getting a computer to display your script. Unfortunately that has been relatively technical up until now, accomplished either by using font foundry oriented tools like Font Forge or Font Lab __or__ by using _shudder_ raster images.

Conscripter is a simple-to-use `calt` insertion program, specialized to the topic of making nice designer fonts for conlang scripts.

# Concepts & Getting Started

__TL:DR;__

1. Break your conlang script into a series of glyphs.
2. Draw each glyph using your favorite SVG tool.
3. Upload each glyph and give it a substitution.
4. Download your font and use it in Word or Adobe.
5. Report issues here.
