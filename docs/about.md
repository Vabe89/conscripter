## What is Conscripter?

Conscripter is a tool that helps _conlang scripts_ come to reality using _substitution_.

__TL;DR:__ Conscripter takes SVG and puts it into a font that you can use.

Conlang scripts often differ widely from the latin alphabet, and a custom script can add depth and meaning to your conlang. Ideally, a custom font makes this easy to work with.

Unfortunately, creating a custom font is a significant undertaking, especially if your language does not directly map onto the latin alphabet. Consider trying to make a logogram like Egyptian Hieroglyphs, a syllabary like Japanese, or an alphasyllabary like Hangul. Not every conlang warrants a block of unicode like J R R Tolkien's Tengwar.

Conscripter is intended to simplify that process. Upload your glyph as an SVG and specify what text it replaces. Download font.

### Who is this for?

Anybody trying to make a font for their conlang that they can use in tools like Word, Illustrator, Photoshop, their website, or Inkscape.

### Who is this not for?

Are you a hardcore typography nerd who fully understands contextual alternates, chaining, and how the substitution stuff works?

This tool is probably too limited for you - you might get more mileage from something like Font Forge, an excellent tool that I used to check my work here.

Additionally, I'd really appreciate any feedback you can give on the end result or pointers on how to improve this app to be more useful.
