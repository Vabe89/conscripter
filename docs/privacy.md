## Privacy Policy

__Last Updated: April 17, 2019__

This app does not collect or store your data in anyway. No data that you send is transmitted to the server beyond the initial requests sent from your browser to load the page. All information you provide to this app remains on your computer.

While editing, any information you have given to the app will be stored locally in your browser's `LocalStorage`, a cache located on your computer. This is to provide you the ability to jump in and out, accidentally close the tab, and recover from crashes. Please consult your browser provider for more information about `LocalStorage`.

Clicking `Save` will download a `.json` to your computer, which contains a plain text representation of the data you have given to the app. You can then manually `Load` this data back into the app.
